== Known Issues

There is a bug in Jasmine (not this project) if your YAML parser happens to be +Psych+.  If you are affected by it, you will see an error message like:

    lib/ruby/1.9.1/psych.rb:148:in `parse': couldn't parse YAML at line 56 column 5 (Psych::SyntaxError)

The issue is that +Psych+ chokes on some YAML that other parsers do not.  In this case, the problem is the asterisk:

    spec_files:
      - **/*[sS]pec.js

As a workaround, quote the string values:

    spec_files:
      - '**/*[sS]pec.js'
